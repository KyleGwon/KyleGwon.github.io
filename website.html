		<center><p class="heading heading-padding">Background</p>
			<p class="small normal">After learning python, my first coding language, I wanted to acquire more information. I decided that one way would be to learn a new computer science language. After pondering my options, I concluded that the most practical language to learn would be HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is mainly used to display forms multimedia, such as text and images. Not quite satisfied with what I would create using HTML, I decided I needed to learn another language that I could partner with HTML to make what I create look nicer. I decided that the perfect language to do this would be CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. This language would allow me to add size dimensions, colors, and much more. Although it didn't have as many possibilities as other languages, like JavaScript, but offered simplicity instead.<br><br>The languages were easy to pick up but applying them proved to be difficult. There were many things that I had to look up, like how to do a local hyperlink, or use media queries. Plus, getting the spacing just right took a long time. There is also the fact that as my life changes, my website does too, making my website never complete.
			</p>
		<p class="heading heading-padding">Why?</p>
			<p class="small normal">Creating this website displays two primary things: me and my projects. Another function of my website is to help me retain my HTML and CSS knowledge because of the constant changes and tweaks that I do. The website doesn't just help with the HTML and CSS, but the Python too. It motivates me to do more projects because every project that I complete, I add to the website. While it shows my projects, it also acts as a small bio for those who are interested.</p>		<p class="heading heading-padding">What I Learned</p>
			<p class="small normal">There were certain things that I did not learn during the Udemy Bootcamp that I utilized on my website, like media queries. The way that I, and most web designers, used media queries is to create a responsive design website. This means that it can be used by different screen sizes, even tablet-sized screens. It wasn't a hard concept to grasp and it was pretty easy to use too. I think that using media queries is essential to creating a good website, for without it, the website would only be accommodated to one screen size. Another thing that I learned was how to use pseudo-classes in CSS. They allow you to change something when you hover, click, and do other things. This was important for me to learn because this is what makes the website features more interesting. You can enlarge a picture, or change the color of a button. There are so many more things you can do with these pseudo-classes, and it is important to know them. The last thing that I learned while making the website was transitions. Transitions are not as important as the use of media queries, but they add a nice aesthetic to the website. They can be useful when using pseudo-classes because you can make the visual changes more apparent and appealing to the viewer. All in all, I think that if you are trying to build a website, it would be useful to learn all media queries, pseudo-classes, and transitions, in addition to the basics.</p></center>
